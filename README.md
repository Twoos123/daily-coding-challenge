### Problem Description

**Trie Pattern Matching with Wildcards**

Given a Trie structure and a set of strings that may contain wildcards (`*`), implement a method to check if any of the strings match the pattern of a given word. The wildcard character `*` can be used to match any sequence of characters in the word.

### Example Input/Output

**Input:**
- Words to be inserted into the Trie: ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
- Patterns to be matched: ["ap*le", "b*na*"]
  
**Output:**
- For the pattern "ap*le": True (since "apple" is in the Trie)
- For the pattern "b*na*": True (since "banana" is in the Trie)
  
### Constraints
- The length of each word and pattern does not exceed 2000 characters.
- Only lowercase English letters and the wildcard character `*` are used.

### Solution

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True

    def search(self, word):
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.is_end_of_word

    def starts_with(self, prefix):
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return True

def trie_pattern_matching(trie, patterns):
    results = []
    
    for pattern in patterns:
        node = trie.root
        
        is_match = False
        
        i = j = 0
        while i < len(pattern) and j < len(node.children):
            if pattern[i] == '*':
                if i + 1 < len(pattern) and pattern[i + 1] != '*':
                    results.append(False)
                    break
                
                j += 1
                i += 1
                while j < len(node.children):
                    if '*' not in pattern[j:]:
                        results.append(False)
                        break
                    
                    results.append(True)
                    break
                
            elif pattern[i] == node.children[j].char:
                node = node.children[j]
                i += 1
                j += 1
            
            else:
                break
        
        if i == len(pattern) and j == len(node.children):
            results.append(True)
        
        else:
            results.append(False)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
trie = Trie()
trie.insert("apple")
trie.insert("banana")
trie.insert("cherry")

patterns = ["ap*le", "b*na*"]
print(trie_pattern_matching(trie.root, patterns)) # Output: [True, True]
```

### Analysis

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of inserting a word into the Trie is `O(m)`, where `m` is the length of the word.
   - The time complexity of searching for a word in the Trie is also `O(m)`.
   - The time complexity for checking if a word starts with a given prefix is `O(m)` as well.
   - The time complexity of checking patterns with wildcards against words in the Trie is `O(n*m)`, where `n` is the number of patterns and `m` is typically less than or equal to the length of a word due to wildcard constraints.

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - The space complexity of the Trie itself is related to the number and lengths of inserted words. In the worst case, it can be `O(N*L)`, where `N` is the number of words and `L` is the average length of a word.

3. **Optimality:**
   - The solution uses a standard Trie structure optimized for string operations.
   - The pattern matching algorithm iterates through each character in both the pattern and the Trie, which is efficient given that wildcards can be used to match any sequence of characters.

### Difficulty Rating

Explanation:
The problem requires implementing a Trie and then using it to perform pattern matching with wildcards. While the Trie operations themselves are standard and well-understood, introducing wildcards adds complexity. The solution needs to handle edge cases where wildcards can match any sequence of characters, making it slightly more challenging than basic Trie operations. However, it's still within the realm of manageable complexity for an experienced programmer familiar with Tries and string algorithms.
