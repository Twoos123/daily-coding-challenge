## Today's Challenge

Difficulty: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5)

**DIFFICULTY: 4**

**Challenge Title: Minimum Number of Operations to Clear a Stack**

**Problem Description:**
Given a stack of integers, determine the minimum number of operations (pop and push) required to clear the stack completely. The goal is to find the shortest sequence of operations that results in an empty stack.

**Example Input/Output:**
- **Input:** Stack `[2, 5, 3, 1]`
- **Output:** `4` (because we need to pop and push the elements in any order 4 times to clear the stack)

**Constraints:**
- The stack will only contain positive integers.
- The problem does not specify any additional constraints on the order in which elements are popped or pushed.

### Optimal Solution

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a simple strategy based on the fact that each operation (pop or push) reduces the size of the stack by one. Since we need to clear the stack, we aim to reduce its size from `n` to `0`. Therefore, we need at least `n` operations.

Here’s an implementation in Python:

```python
def min_operations_to_clear_stack(stack):
    """
    Returns the minimum number of operations (pop and push) required to clear the stack.

    :param stack: A list of integers representing the stack.
    :return: The minimum number of operations required.
    """
    # The size of the stack is the number of elements in it.
    return len(stack)
```

### Analysis

#### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(1), because it involves a constant number of operations (accessing the length of the list) regardless of the input size.

#### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is also O(1), because we do not use any additional data structures that scale with the input size.

### Explanation

The key insight here is that any sequence of `pop` and `push` operations will result in a total count equal to the initial size of the stack. Therefore, finding this minimum count directly from the size of the stack is both efficient and optimal.

This solution does not require manipulating the stack itself but rather focuses on calculating a property (the minimum number of operations) based on its current state. This approach ensures both time and space efficiency, making it suitable for a difficulty rating of 4.
