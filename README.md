### Coding Challenge: "Maximum Subarray Sum with Rotations"

#### Problem Description

Given an array `arr` of integers and an integer `k`, find the maximum sum of a subarray after rotating the array `k` times. The array can be rotated in either clockwise or counterclockwise direction.

**Example Input/Output:**
- Input: `arr = [1, 2, -1, 3, 5], k = 3`
- Output: `9` (Maximum sum subarray is `[3, 5]` after rotating the array)
  
#### Constraints:
- The array `arr` contains at least one element.
- The integer `k` is non-negative.

#### Task

Implement a solution using Dynamic Programming (DP) with arrays that efficiently calculates the maximum sum of a subarray after rotating the array `k` times.

### Analysis of Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The approach involves calculating prefix sums and suffix sums for the given array before and after rotations. This can be done in O(n) time where n is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity:** We need to store prefix sums and suffix sums which requires additional space proportional to the length of the array. Thus, the space complexity is also O(n).

### Most Efficient Solution in Python

```python
def maxSubarraySumRotated(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    suffix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_sums[i] = prefix_sums[i - 1] + arr[i - 1]
    
    # Calculate suffix sums
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        suffix_sums[i] = suffix_sums[i + 1] + arr[i - 1]
    
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    
    # Rotate the array and find maximum subarray sum
    for i in range(k + 1):
        current_sum = prefix_sums[i] + suffix_sums[n - (n - i)] - arr[i - 1]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
    return max_sum
```

### Detailed Explanation of the Algorithm

1. **Prefix Sums Calculation:**
   - We calculate prefix sums by iterating over the array from left to right and storing the cumulative sum for each position.
   - This step allows us to efficiently calculate sums involving elements before a certain position.

2. **Suffix Sums Calculation:**
   - We calculate suffix sums by iterating over the array from right to left and storing the cumulative sum for each position.
   - This step allows us to efficiently calculate sums involving elements after a certain position.

3. **Rotation and Maximum Subarray Sum Calculation:**
   - We rotate the array by iterating over possible rotations (`k + 1` times).
   - For each rotation, we compute the sum of elements using previously calculated prefix and suffix sums.
   - We keep track of the maximum subarray sum encountered during these rotations.

### Why This Approach is Optimal

- **Efficient Sum Calculations:** Using prefix and suffix sums allows us to avoid redundant calculations of subarray sums by leveraging pre-computed values.
- **Linear Time Complexity:** The overall time complexity remains O(n) because we only need to traverse the array once for both prefix and suffix calculations.
- **Linear Space Complexity:** Additional space complexity is also linear with respect to the length of the input array, making this solution efficient in terms of both time and space.

### Trade-Offs

- While our solution has optimal time complexity (O(n)), it requires additional space for storing prefix and suffix sums which is also O(n). This trade-off is necessary for achieving linear time complexity without compromising on efficiency.

### Difficulty Rating

The problem requires an understanding of dynamic programming concepts and how to leverage prefix and suffix sums effectively. It involves managing additional arrays for calculations but remains manageable with clear explanations and steps provided above.
