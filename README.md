### Problem Description

**Challenge: "Island Counter with DFS and Topological Sort"**

**Objective:**
Given an undirected graph representing islands and rivers, use Depth-First Search (DFS) to count the number of islands and then perform a Topological Sort to arrange the islands in a linear order based on their finishing times.

**Input:**
- An adjacency list representation of the undirected graph.
- Functionality to add new rivers (edges) between islands (vertices).

**Output:**
- The number of islands initially present in the graph.
- A linear order of islands based on their finishing times from a DFS traversal.

### Constraints
- The graph is undirected.
- The number of vertices (islands) is in the range [1, 1000].
- The number of edges (rivers) is in the range [1, 10000].

### Example Input/Output

**Input Graph:**
```
adj_list = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}
```

**Initial Output:**
```
Number of islands: 6

Linear order based on finishing times:
['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']
```

### Constraints Analysis

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - **Island Counting (DFS):** \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges.
   - **Topological Sort:** \(O(V + E)\) for a general case but can be optimized to \(O(V + E)\) if we use Kahn's algorithm or DFS-based approach which is suitable here.

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - **DFS:** \(O(V + E)\) for storing recursion stack or queue used during DFS.
   - **Topological Sort:** \(O(V + E)\) for storing visited nodes and adjacency list.

### Solution

#### Island Counter with DFS
```python
def count_islands(graph):
    visited = set()
    island_count = 0

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            island_count += 1
            dfs(node)
    
    return island_count
```

#### Topological Sort using DFS
```python
def topological_sort(graph):
    visited = set()
    ordering = []

    def dfs(node):
        visited.add(node)
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                dfs(neighbor)
        ordering.append(node)

    for node in graph:
        if node not in visited:
            dfs(node)
    
    return ordering[::-1]  # Reversing the list to get correct ordering

# Example usage:
adj_list = {
    'A': ['B', 'C'],
    'B': ['A', 'D'],
    'C': ['A', 'F'],
    'D': ['B'],
    'E': ['F'],
    'F': ['C', 'E']
}

print("Number of islands:", count_islands(adj_list))
print("Linear order based on finishing times:", topological_sort(adj_list))
```

### Complexity Analysis

#### Island Counting (DFS)
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(V + E)\)
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(V + E)\)

#### Topological Sort using DFS
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(V + E)\)
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(V + E)\)

#### Combined Complexity
Since both operations are performed sequentially, the overall time complexity remains \(O(V + E)\). The space complexity remains \(O(V + E)\) due to the storage required for visited sets and recursion stack during DFS.

### Difficulty Rating
****

This challenge requires a good understanding of both DFS and Topological Sort concepts. While the island counting part is straightforward, performing a topological sort adds an additional layer of complexity that makes it suitable for intermediate-level problems. The combined operations and handling of both counting and ordering make it moderately challenging, hence rated as 3 out of 5.
